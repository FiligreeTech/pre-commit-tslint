### Using Tslint with pre-commit

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml

    -   repo: git://github.com/awebdeveloper/pre-commit-tslint/
        sha: ''  # Use the sha or tag you want to point at
        hooks:
        -   id: tslint
            additional_dependencies: ['tslint@5.0.0']
        
 ```       
   To use with ```tslint-eslint-rules``` include it as additional_dependencies

   To check type or if linter complaints of type (but this will slow down your commit)
```yaml
     hooks:
        -   id: tslint
            args: ['--project','tsconfig.json','--type-check']
```
